# Gun-Violence-in-the-USA
<p>The objective of this project is to gain a better understanding of gun violence in the United States.  The target in the project was to try to find a pattern regarding gun violence as far as where in the United States they were happening, what type of gun laws exist in specific states and what was the cause of the act of violence.  Predicting gun violence is beyond the scope of this project as we are more concerned about identifying the patterns in gun violence across the United States.  The idea here is that hopefully by seeing patterns in the data we can pinpoint on what it is that increases gun violence, compare and contrast high gun violence areas with low gun violence areas.  When analyzing the data and being able to see the big factors contributing to gun violence it is then when we can try to focus on those issues in order to help reduce violence.</p>

<b>Below I listed project goals:</b>
<p>Analyze data and recognize particular patterns or recurrences in order to gain any further knowledge about, why? , when? and where?</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of various trends across the number of people killed or injured per year.</p>
<p>Exploring Time Related trend / State-wise trend of Gun violence.</p>
<p>Visualize locations that are more prone to have the event and see if it matches with the modeling algorithm result.</p>
